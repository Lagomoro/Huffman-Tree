Hi all, you may have noticed me rummaging around lately.  I've been pretty much absent for a handful of years, but I got an itch recently to get back involved.  Thanks go to Daniel for picking up the slack while I and others were dormant and moving us into modern times with Github! My goal With the shift to github out of the way, we've decide to release a new version of rabbitvcs. It's available via github, and contains 16 important bug fixes and features. Please report issues via github We've uploaded Ubuntu packages to the main PPA, and other distributions are encouraged to produce their own packages as needed.
